It looks like you need to add the location of your log4j.properties file to the Classpath in Eclipse.

Make sure your project is open in Eclipse, then click on the "Run" menu at the top of Eclipse and click on the following:

Run
Run Configurations
Classpath (tab)
User Entries
Advanced (button on the right)
Add Folders
then navigate to the folder that contains your log4j.properties file
Apply
Run
The error message should no longer appear.
